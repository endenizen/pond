Follow the Heroku instructions for setting up your local workstation on this page:

http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python

Then you'll need to set two environment variables:

RDIO_API_KEY
RDIO_API_SECRET

You get these variables from the Rdio developer site (sign in and create a new app):

http://developer.rdio.com/

An easy way to set up your vars is to create a file called env.sh and make it look like this:

export RDIO_API_KEY=yourkey
export RDIO_API_SECRET=yoursecret

Then just type "source env.sh" before you run your app locally. Just make sure not to commit your env.sh file.
